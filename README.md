# Data Structures and Algorithms Overview

This repository contains implementations of various data structures and algorithms based on the concepts covered in a video tutorial on Data Structures and Algorithms. The tutorial covered a wide range of topics including:

- Stacks
- Queues
- Similarities and differences between stacks and queues
- Sets
- Binary Search Tree
- Linked Lists
- Tries
- Essential methods such as `peek`, `pop`,`push`, `size`, `reduce`, etc.

## Implemented Algorithms

### Stack Algorithm

Utilizing the knowledge gained from the tutorial, I derived different approaches to implement the stack algorithm. These implementations can be found in the `practicestack.js` file.

### Mean and Median Calculation

Additionally, I wrote simple algorithms to find the mean and median of an array of numbers. These algorithms are implemented in their respective files.

Feel free to explore the implementations and provide feedback or suggestions for improvement.
